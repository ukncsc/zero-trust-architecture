# Focus your monitoring on devices and services

Given that devices and services are more exposed to network attacks than in traditional architectures, it’s important that comprehensive monitoring is carried out.

Focus on device and service monitoring; what are devices requesting from services, what actions are they performing, what data are they accessing. Your monitoring should link back to the policies that you set, verifying they are being enforced as you expect.

User devices within a traditional walled garden network architecture use a VPN to send all traffic through a controlled path, which enables traffic to be inspected. In a zero trust architecture, this chokepoint isn’t available and protective monitoring has to be moved onto each device.

Although the network is untrusted and assumed hostile, network monitoring is still important to ensure good performance and good cyber hygiene. Network monitoring should be carried out on your local networks to identify rogue devices and help identify malicious activity, especially if you’re hosting on-premise services. Coupled with device monitoring, network monitoring can help improve visibility and correlation; for example, you could trace network connections to the process on the device that generated them.
